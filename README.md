    <h1>Blackjack Game</h1>
    <p>This is a simple implementation of the classic card game Blackjack. The game allows a player to play against a computerized dealer.</p>

    <h2>How to Play</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Run the script.</li>
        <li>Enter your name when prompted.</li>
        <li>Follow the prompts to decide whether to take another card or not.</li>
        <li>Try to get as close to 21 points without going over.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Rules</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>At the beginning of the game, you and the dealer are dealt two cards each.</li>
        <li>You can choose to 'hit' (take another card) or 'stand' (keep your current hand).</li>
        <li>If the total value of your hand exceeds 21, you lose the game.</li>
        <li>If you choose to stand, the dealer will take cards until their total is 17 or higher.</li>
        <li>The winner is the one who has a hand closest to 21 without going over.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How the Code Works</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The code uses Python's <code>random</code> module to simulate card dealing.</li>
        <li>It defines functions to deal cards, calculate the total value of a hand, and run the game.</li>
        <li>The game logic is implemented mainly through conditional statements.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Python 3.x</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Running the Code</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Clone the repository or download the <code>blackjack.py</code> file.</li>
        <li>Open a terminal or command prompt.</li>
        <li>Navigate to the directory containing <code>blackjack.py</code>.</li>
        <li>Run the script using the command <code>python blackjack.py</code>.</li>
        <li>Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.</li>
    </ol>
