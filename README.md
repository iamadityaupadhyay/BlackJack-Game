Blackjack Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic card game Blackjack. The game allows a player to play against a computerized dealer.

How to Play
Run the script.
Enter your name when prompted.
Follow the prompts to decide whether to take another card or not.
Try to get as close to 21 points without going over.
Rules
At the beginning of the game, you and the dealer are dealt two cards each.
You can choose to 'hit' (take another card) or 'stand' (keep your current hand).
If the total value of your hand exceeds 21, you lose the game.
If you choose to stand, the dealer will take cards until their total is 17 or higher.
The winner is the one who has a hand closest to 21 without going over.
How the Code Works
The code uses Python's random module to simulate card dealing.
It defines functions to deal cards, calculate the total value of a hand, and run the game.
The game logic is implemented mainly through conditional statements.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Running the Code
Clone the repository or download the blackjack.py file.
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory containing blackjack.py.
Run the script using the command python blackjack.py.
Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.
